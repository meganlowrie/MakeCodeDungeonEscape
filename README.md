# MakeCodeDungeonEscape
Dungeon maze game + scavenger hunt
Goal: find and collect the 3 chests while avoiding enemies.
When all 3 chests are collected, a timer starts and you must find the exit before the time runs out while collecting as many chests as you can.
If the time runs out before finding the exit, game over and you lose.
Press A to shoot a projectile to the right and B to shoot a projectile to the left to kill the enemies in your path.
Up and Down can be used to shoot projectiles for enemies in the vertical direction.
Each time you hit an enemy, health decreases by 1.
When health = 0 then game over.
