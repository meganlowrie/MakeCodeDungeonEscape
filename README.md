Dungeon maze game + scavenger hunt
Goal: find and collect the 3 chests while avoiding snakes.
When all 3 chests are collected, a timer starts and you must find the exit before the time runs out.
If the time runs out before finding the exit, game over and you lose.
Press A to shoot a projectile to the right and B to shoot a projectile to the left to kill the snakes in your path.
Each time you hit a snake, health decreases by 1.
When health = 0 game over.
